    <string name="text_whatwedo">The vision of University Programs is to be the central
        location for all on-campus programming. We will share our resources with other
        campus departments, student organizations and community partners to assist them
        in the planning, promotion and implementation of their events. In addition, we
        will engage students through programs to play a more active role in their experience
        and education at the Capstone.</string>
