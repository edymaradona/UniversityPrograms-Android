    <string name="text_whatwedo">The vision of University Programs is to be the central
        location for all on-campus programming. We will share our resources with other
        campus departments, student organizations and community partners to assist them
        in the planning, promotion and implementation of their events. In addition, we
        will engage students through programs to play a more active role in their experience
        and education at the Capstone.</string>

    My Job: I have been with University Programs since September 2012 working as an event programmer and communications specialist.
        Upon receiving my Bachelor\'s in public relations from the University of Alabama in August 2013, I am continuing working with
        UP as a graduate assistant. Currently, I oversee the event programmers and provide them with advice and support. It is my
        goal to ensure that all programs are fully developed and implemented so we can provide the Capstone with exceptional programs
